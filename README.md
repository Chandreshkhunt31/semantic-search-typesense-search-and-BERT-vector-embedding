# Semantic Search with Typesense, Pinecone, and BERT

## Overview
This project implements a **semantic search engine** using **Typesense, Pinecone, and BERT-based vector embeddings**. It allows efficient retrieval of relevant documents by leveraging vector embeddings and similarity search.

## Features
- **BERT-based vector embedding** for text representation.
- **Typesense** for fast, typo-tolerant full-text search.
- **Pinecone** for scalable, high-performance vector search.
- **Hybrid search** combining keyword and semantic matching.

## Usage
- **Index Documents**: Convert text into vector embeddings and store them in Typesense/Pinecone.
- **Search Queries**: Input a query to retrieve semantically relevant results.
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine full-text and vector search for optimal results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **BERT** (Sentence Transformers)
- **Typesense**
- **Pinecone**
